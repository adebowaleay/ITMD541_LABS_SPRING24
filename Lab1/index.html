<!-- Bio -->
I am a (fall) Class of 2024 Information Technology and Management Major with a focus in entreprenuership and management. I have previously encountered HTML/ CSS but have not worked with it in a long time. I am looking forward to learning the language and staying up to date with the newest techniques, as well as learnig how to use APIs which is something I have always been curious about.
