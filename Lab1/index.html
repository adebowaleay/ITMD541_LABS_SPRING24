        <!-- Bio -->
        <p>
            I am a (fall) Class of 2024 Information Technology and Management Major with a focus in entrepreneurship and management. 
            I have previously encountered HTML/CSS but have not worked with it in a long time. 
            I am looking forward to learning the language and staying up to date with the newest techniques, 
            as well as learning how to use APIs which is something I have always been curious about.
